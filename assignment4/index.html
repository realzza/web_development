    <h1>Design Iteration</h1>
    <p class="author_info">Ziang Zhou &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class 22@Duke</p>
    <h2>Color Theme</h2>
    <p>
      The Color I picked for presento is orange, red and their gradients. The
      reason for orange is that is a cool color, but also is the color we picked
      one year ago. Their combinations creates a warm and vigorous vibe.

    <h2>Major Iterations</h2>
    <p>
      In the previous feedback on assignment3, professor Symuleski 
      mainly suggested two potential improvements. The first improvement 
      is that the background of the landing page can be a way to
      communicate the purpose of our application to the users. The 
      second improvement is that use demos/gifs to give users an 
      instinctive insight on how Presento can help them, just like 
      the way <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> did. The common thing of these two suggestions 
      is that the landing page should be more communicative and 
      instinctive to give users a clearer overview. While I agree with
      this idea, I have some iterated ideas regarding the background. 
      After view many tech corps landing pages, I found that pure color 
      or simply gradient color can make it appears Premium, while an 
      inappropriate background image might ruin the tech vibe of your 
      website. Thus I decided to keep the media advice, but iterate 
      the background image with gradient colors.
    </p>
    <h2>Landing Page</h2>
    <p>
      Below is the screenshot of my landing page. As I mentioned in 
      the major iteration, there are two iterations compared to my 
      last design. The first is that the background is set to a 
      gradient color. And the second is that I added a prototype 
      screenshot of the Presento mobile app. For now, it is merely 
      a screenshot. In the future, it can be replaced by a video 
      demo if available.

    <h2>Product Page</h2>
    <p>
      For now, the product page is quite simple. It mainly introduced what our product is for, and what functionality does our product has. New updates, if any, will be also be presented on this page in the future.

    <h2>Team Page</h2>
    <p>
      The team page is displayed with flex. When the screen gets smaller, you will only see one column of team member introductions.
