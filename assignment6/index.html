    <h1>API & Library Research</h1>

    <p>
      For now, a possible final project is not hundred percent fixed yet. It may
      be the further polished version of my
      <a href="../assignment5/home.html" class="links">midterm project</a>, so
      some great new ideas. Thus I am researching javascript libraries based on
      various possible potential functionalities.

      The connection that could be built between presento and social media could
      be a short video or a screenshot of an improving communicative
      performance. Thus for social media apis, tiktok and IG can be good
      options, since they are the dominator in video social form and image
      social form.
    </p>
    <h2>API Research</h2>
    <p>
      For social media apis, I can only find unofficial apis that supports these
      two platforms. Their links are attached below.

    <h2>Javascripts Libraries</h2>
    <p>
      As I mentioned in the <a href="#ideas" class="links">ideas</a> section, my
      final project is still undecided. But one functionality that I would like
      to add, no matter what final project I will be working on, is to access
      web with database via javascript, to either enable user registration, or
      information collection for user/audience feedback. To realize this
      functionality, as is introduced by this
      <a
        href="https://dzone.com/articles/create-user-registration-and-login-using-web-api-a"
        class="links"
        >essay</a
      >, react.js is something I should know about.
    </p>

      /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jquery is another good choice. As I have navigate through different
      materials, I found that jquery is handy to make javascript programming on
      your website much more easier by offering lightweight and accessible apis
      to avoid unnecessary heavy coding.
