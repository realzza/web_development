    <h1>Proposal - Presento</h1>
    <p class="author_info">Ziang Zhou &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class 22@Duke</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This proposal is about the sitemap and wireframe of an application --
      Presento. I started up Presento at the beginning of this year with a few
      friends, focusing on using AI technology to bring a difference to people's
      communication. This program has been stuck for a while since none of the
      team members are experts in UI/UX design, thus I see this as a great
      opportunity to progress and make Presento more complete.
    </p>
    <h2>Sitemap</h2>
    <p>
      I am planning to build my UX design portfolio with the following sitemap
      architecture. The design is instinctive to the users. Presento is an app,
      where we would like to display our product in the first place. After that,
      users will care about the price of our products. Thus we set the "Pricing
      division" right after the "Product" Page. Inspired by the
      <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> website, which is also a
      product-based app, there is a "Blog" division that updates the latest news
      of their product. Since Presento might involve more algorithm stuff, the
      "Blogs" can be some technical sharings contributed by the Presento
      Community. Last but not least is the "Teams" page, where you can see the
      contribution of each team member, and most importantly, find a way to join
      us!

    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>
      The landing page of Presento will contain some of the most important
      information, such as Product, Pricing, Blogs, Team, etc. Each division
      links to a page to expand the content itself. The landing page will be
      quite simple. It contains a slogan of our app, a one-sentence description
      of our mission, and a get started button.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      As we can see in the navigation bar on the home page, you can access "Get
      Started" easily, which will show you clearer guidance of what you can do
      on our home page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then on each block in the "Get Started" page, it links to a division that
      expands itself. You have four options to get started, including
      <b><i>Product, Blogs, Pricings</i></b> and <b><i>Team</i></b
      >.
    </p>
    <p><img src="images/Get Started.png" alt="get started page" /></p>
    <p>
      Since the thematic color of our application is orange, I colored all the
      button and clickable texts/links to orange. Below is the design of the
      entire wireframes.
