    <h1>Final Project Proposal & Wireframes</h1>
    <p class="author_info">Ziang Zhou &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class 22@Duke</p>
    <h2 id="ideas">Proposal</h2>
    <p>
      For this proposal, I plan to deploy a bird-related web app, which mainly
      has two functions: 1) Fetch the latest region-specific bird-spotting
      information. 2) Web-based bird sound classification. The former function
      will be using the location API to get the current location and the
      <a class="links" href="https://ebird.org/explore">ebird API v2</a>
      to fetch information of bird-spotting near this region. The latter
      functionality will deploy the bird classification model through
      javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are still some difficulties to finish the first function, such as
      mapping location (long, lat) to ebird-api-specific region code, which is
      indispensable in API JSON fetching. Moreover, ebird requires daily
      updating API, therefore causing difficulties for deployment. I plan to
      finish the first function and move to the next function if everything goes
      on well with the first one and time permits.
    </p>
    <h2>API Adjustment</h2>
    <p>
      To get the bird activities near the user, the application needs to be
      acknowledged about the user's location. Therefore, the
      <a class="links" href="http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json"
        >map api</a
      >
      will be used to fetch the latitude and longitude of the user's location.
      The location information will be used by
      <a class="links" href="https://ebird.org/explore">ebird API v2</a>, and
      return a JSON of recent bird activities spotted in that region.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tested my idea by writing code to fetch data from the API, and they
      succeeded. It is also worth noticing that ebird api requires an
      authentication to use, and the authentication is daily-authorizing.

    <h2>Sitemap</h2>
    <p>
      The sitemap has a simple structure, contructed of <i>Search</i> Section
      and <i>Identify</i> Section. In each of the sections, there are two pages
      respectively demonstrating before and after searching or identifying.

      As I mentioned in the
      <a class="links" href="#ideas" class="links">ideas</a> section, my final
      project is still undecided. But one functionality that I would like to
      add, no matter what final project I will be working on, is to access web
      with database via javascript, to either enable user registration, or
      information collection for user/audience feedback. To realize this
      functionality, as is introduced by this
      <a
        href="https://dzone.com/articles/create-user-registration-and-login-using-web-api-a"
        class="links"
        >essay</a
      >, react.js is something I should know about.

    </p>
    <p>
      Jquery is another good choice. As I have navigate through different
      materials, I found that jquery is handy to make javascript programming on
      your website much more easier by offering lightweight and accessible apis
      to avoid unnecessary heavy coding.
